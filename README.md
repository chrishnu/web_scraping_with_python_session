### Why Python for Web Scraping?

Python is a versatile programming language that can be used for a wide range of tasks, including web scraping. It has a large and active community that has developed a wide range of libraries and frameworks for web scraping, such as Beautiful Soup and Scrapy. These libraries make it easy to extract data from websites, even if you have little to no experience with programming.

Python also has powerful built-in tools that are useful for web scraping, such as regular expressions and the requests library. Regular expressions are a way to search for patterns in text, and they can be used to extract specific data from websites. The requests library is a way to send HTTP requests in Python, and it is used to access the HTML code of a website.
